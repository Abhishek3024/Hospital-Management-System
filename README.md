# Hospital Management System

The hospital management system will provide services to the hospital staff. The database will store the data of the in and outpatients, patients’ medical history, special medication provided(if any) etc. Personal details of in-patients like family, address, phone number and other contact details will be recorded. It will also provide data on the hospital’s present infrastructure like available beds, wards, equipment etc. Staff records like available doctors, nurses, ward-boys will also be maintained. The doctors could be trainees, permanent, visiting or any kind of specialist. Their personal records, professional experience will also be maintained. List of appointments for the outpatients will be recorded. Finances of the hospitals like salaries of employees, cost of medicines, equipment, and other stuff will also be recorded. This will help to generate a bill and keep a track of the revenue generated and other finances of the hospital.
